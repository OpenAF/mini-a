      Go through all markdown documentation files in the current folder and sub-folders (excluding the .git folder if it exists).
      For each markdown file found, analyze all other non-markdown files in the repository to identify any relevant and significant changes that should be reflected in the documentation.
      Update each markdown file with accurate information about:
      - New features, functions, or APIs that have been added
      - Changed behavior, parameters, or configuration options
      - Deprecated or removed functionality
      - Updated examples or usage patterns
      - New dependencies or requirements
      
      Only make changes when they are relevant and significant. Preserve the existing documentation structure and style.
      Ensure all code examples in the documentation remain accurate and reflect the current implementation.
