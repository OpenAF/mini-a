# MCP Dependency Resolution
# Defines dependencies between MCP servers
# When an MCP is loaded, its dependencies are automatically loaded first

dependencies:
  # Example: mcp-mini-a depends on having other MCPs available
  # mcp-mini-a:
  #   - mcp-file
  #   - mcp-shell

  # No default dependencies - will be populated as needed
  {}

# Circular dependency detection
circular_check_enabled: true
